# Calculator in ASM



## 📖 Overview
One of the biggest projects I will be working on 


## ✨ Features

**Nothing** - Just a basic program that executes arithmetic equations 


## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin, clone the repository and build it using your preferred ASM compiler (in that case, it is nasm):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enzzzh/Calculator
cd Calculator
```

## 💻 Usage

Once set up, run the program by executing:

```bash
nasm -f elf32 calculator.asm -o calculator.o
ld -m elf_i386 -s -o calculator calculator.o
./calculator
```
